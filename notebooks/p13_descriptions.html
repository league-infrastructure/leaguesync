Students first learn to write simple console applications using primitive data types, basic operators, and control flow constructs such as loops and conditional statements. As the introductory material delves deeper, the courses explore arrays, methods, and the concept of modularity in code design. The importance of debugging and error handling is also emphasized, along with an introduction to the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and its tools that streamline coding in Java.</p><p>Moving into intermediate and advanced topics, the series shifts focus to object-oriented programming (OOP), teaching students how to design and implement scalable and maintainable applications using classes, objects, and interfaces. Key OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism are thoroughly covered. The curriculum then advances to complex concepts including data structures, algorithms, and generics. Students gain practical experience with Java's collection framework, file I/O operations, and multithreading. In the final stages, the series introduces enterprise-level development, covering frameworks like Spring and Hibernate, RESTful web services, and Java's role in cloud-based applications. Concurrently, best practices such as unit testing, design patterns, and version control are integrated, preparing students for professional Java development roles.</p><br></div></div><div class="camp"><h2>Programming Classes</h2></div><div class="camp"><h2>AI Camp</h2><div class="description"><p><img alt="" src="https://d1nqv8xdwxria6.cloudfront.net/uploads/rich_text_editor_photo/image/ade85db9-a03d-47e7-aaf1-a72305c99d24/image.png"><br></p><p>AI camp is designed to introduce your child to the exciting world of AI and machine learning.
